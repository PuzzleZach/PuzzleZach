## Quick Rundown
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PuzzleZach, a tools programmer in the tech industry with a passion for building tools.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development and production, with a focus on finding new ways to tell stories. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any tools to assist creators

## Some things that I have done in the past:
- CS50 capstone coming soon - Game Dev Job board built using Flask and Sqlite. Will pursue this as a full project.
- [EmThreat](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/EmThreat) is a tool to help system administrators identify new trends in vulnerable software. 
- [TwitterFollowing](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/TwitterFollowing) is a quick utility to pull info of people you follow to save contact information.
- [PyJira](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/PyJira) is a short utility to making YARA rule files from an input file.
- [Glass](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/lookingglass) is a set of utilities to automatically search through IOS apps, specifically the GlassDoor app.
- [Hasher](https://github.com/PuzzleZach/hasher) is a quick tool that will obtain the hashes of all files in a provided path.

## Current work:
- All internal, but eager to start new projects.
