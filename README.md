## Mini bio:

Hey I am Zach! I have been in all-purpose roles for the last few years ranging from maintaining live operations, developing tools for teams, and planning out projects. My core passion is storytelling and I always believe that we can use our code to tell engaging stories. I am always open to connecting with anyone who is passionate about digital entertainment.

I have been jumping between Unity and Unreal Engine for the better part of 3 years, finding myself more comfortable with C# and understanding the Unity API. In my current role I've taught myself 2 separate sets of API's in the last year to produce tools used in production.
